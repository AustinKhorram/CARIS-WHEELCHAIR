# CARIS-WHEELCHAIR
### ENPH 459 Capstone Project by Keenan McConkey, Joel Ahn, &amp; Austin Khorram

**Project:** Real-time classification of terrain type (e.g. grass, pavement, sand) for use in smart wheelchairs. To be implemented in a smartphone app which runs image and audio processing software trained using machine learning, and possibly communicating with an IMU on board the wheelchair. User can choose with to run terrain data aquisition for training of ML algorithms or run real-time terrain classification.

**Scope:** data acquisition, data processing, data storage, multi-sensor integration, data analysis, machine learning, app dev

### To-Do:

#### Image Processing

1. Improve sampling rate (currently only 1s)
2. Optimize image resolution while maintaining high sampling rate

#### Audio Processing

1. Optimize encoding and sampling rate
2. Choose a better file format

#### IMU Processing

1. Significantly improve sampling rate

#### Machine Learning

1. Implement outline data pipeline for training algorithms

#### Integration

1. Still far off
