# CARIS-WHEELCHAIR
### ENPH 459 Capstone Project by Keenan McConkey, Joel Ahn, &amp; Austin Khorram

**Project:** Real-time classification of terrain type (e.g. grass, pavement, sand) for use in smart wheelchairs. To be implemented in a smartphone app which runs image and audio processing software trained using machine learning, and possibly communicating with an IMU on board the wheelchair. User can choose with to run terrain data aquisition for training of ML algorithms or run real-time terrain classification.

**Scope:** data acquisition, data processing, data storage, multi-sensor integration, data analysis, machine learning, app dev

### To-Do:

#### Audio Processing

1. Allow relative file locations
2. Implement as functions
3. Train learning algorithms

#### Machine Learning

#### App Development

#### Integration
